# DynamiVox Wavesurfer Configurations
These are the config files we use for labeling datasets. Dark theme included as-per request.
lab files are saves in the HTK format.

Note: don't set these as default as the pitch plot will cause Wavesurfer to quit at start (due to lack of audio).
Dark themes don't have the power plot as the power plot doesn't save/load it's color.
